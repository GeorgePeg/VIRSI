# VIRSI
VIRSI (Voice Interface for Robotic Systems Interaction): Control through ESP-NOW and your voice a robot. The robot we will control is a car. 

# **ESP-NOW - What is it and how to use it**:
ESP-NOW is a data link layer-based wireless communication protocol that reduces five of the seven layers of the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model to a single layer.
In this way, data does not need to be transmitted through the Network Layer, Transport Layer, Session Layer, Presentation Layer, and Application Layer. Data can therefore be transmitted **only through the Physical Layer and the Data Link Layer**. Thus, there is no need for packet headers or decompression programs at each layer, which leads to fast response, reducing the latency caused by packet loss in congested networks.
